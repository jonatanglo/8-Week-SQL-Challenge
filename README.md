I decided to practise my SQL skills so I joined to Danny's Ma #8WeekSQLChallenge where I can deal with real business cases and solve them. I post my journey at my GitHub portfolio. You can find Danny's materials [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).

## Business Case:
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Case Study Questions

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```` sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(m.price) AS total_amount 
FROM sales AS s
INNER JOIN menu AS m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY customer_id ASC
````

#### Steps: 
* Use **JOIN** to merge `sales` and `menu` tables, where `customer_id` comes from `sales` table, and `price` comes from `menu` table.
* Use **SUM** to calculate `total_amount`.
* Aggregate `customer_id` results using **GROUP BY**.
* Sort  `customer_id` alphabetically with **ORDER BY ASC**.
  
#### Result:
customer_id | total_amount
-- | --
A	| 76
B	| 74
C	| 36

* Customer **A** spent 76$ at the restaurant.
* Customer **B** spent 74$ at the restaurant.
* Customer **C** spent 36$ at the restaurant.

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```` sql
SELECT 
customer_id, 
COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visited_days
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
````
#### Steps:
* Use **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)** to count unique days in which customers placed orders.
* Aggregate `customer_id` results using **GROUP BY**.

#### Result:
customer_id | visited_days
-- | --
A	| 4
B	| 6
C	| 2

* Customer **A** visited 4 times the restaurant.
* Customer **B** visited 6 times the restaurant.
* Customer **C** visited 2 times the restaurant.

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```` sql
SELECT
s.customer_id,
MIN(s.order_date) AS order_date,
MIN(m.product_name) AS product_name
FROM sales AS s
LEFT JOIN menu AS m
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id ASC
````

#### Steps:
* Use **MIN(`s.order_date`)** to use first date.
* Use **LEFT JOIN** to merge tables `sales` and `menu` on `product_id` columns.
* Aggregate `customer_id` results using **GROUP BY**.

#### Result:
customer_id | order_date | product_name
-- | -- | --
A |	2021-01-01 | curry
B	| 2021-01-01 | curry
C |	2021-01-01 | ramen

* Customer **A** as first purchased curry.
* Customer **B** as first purchased curry.
* Customer **C** as first purchased ramen.

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
```` sql
SELECT 
    m.product_name ,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM menu AS m
INNER JOIN sales AS s
    ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC
LIMIT 1
````
#### Steps:
* Use **COUNT** to calculate numer of orders.
* Use **INNER JOIN** to merge tables `sales` and `menu` on `product_id` column.
* Aggregate `product_name` results using **GROUP BY**.
* Sort  `number_of_orders` decreasing with **ORDER BY DESC**.
* Return only one result with **LIMIT 1**.

#### Result:
product_name | number_of_orders
-- | --
ramen | 8

* The most purchased item on the menu is **ramen** and it was purchased **8 times**.


### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
